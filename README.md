# What is this repo about?
This repo should help you master Python in a hands-on manner. It consists of hands-on [Swimm](https://swimm.io) Units covering best-practices in Python (from basics to advanced), as well as specific modules or libraries (e.g., `typing`).

This is a public repo maintinaed by [Swimm](https://swimm.io).

# I want to start! What should I do?
* Download and install Swimm (from [here](https://swimm.io/download)).
* Run the following command:
`swimm install https://github.com/swimmio/python_best_practices.git`


Enjoy ðŸ˜Ž

# Prerequisites
* Basic Python knowledge.
* Have `python3` in your path launch Python with a version `>=3.8`. That is, you should be able to launch `python3` from the terminal.

# Playlists Overview

The Playlists in this repo are supposed to present bite-sized exercises (or as we in Swimm call them, _Units_).

## Unit Structure

Before you take your first few steps it's important to set our expectations:

* In each Unit, you will be asked to make some tests pass (use `swimm test` as a shortcut for that) and will be presented with the files necessary for you to edit after you `swimm play`.
* The **technical specifications** of what you need to achieve will be written as docstrings inside the **code itself**.
* The Units' descripions themselves will not focus on teaching Python concepts, but may instead offer some _"Recommended References"_ that will help you solve each specific challenge. We encourage you to search online and dive deeper on your own!

# I have a question
Contact us at `info@swimm.io`.

# I want to contribute
Great, you are welcome to issue a PR. Relevant contributions can be:
* Enhancing existing Units - adding hints, extending the description or summary.
* Adding Units to existing playlists.
* Creating new playlists.
