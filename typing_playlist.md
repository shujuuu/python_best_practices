Python `typing` was introduced in Python 3.5. It provides runtime support for type hints.

Type hints are great - they help catch certain errors, and help you build and maintain a cleaner architecture.

At Orca, we care about `typing` and use it extensively in our codebase. 

To master `typing`, go ahead a Swimm through the `typing` playlist provided by Swimm as part of the "Python Best Practices" repo.

If you haven't used it already,  use the following command to start Swimm from this repo:

`swimm install https://github.com/swimmio/python_best_practices.git`
